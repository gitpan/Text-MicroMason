    Text::MicroMason::Docs::Changes - Change History for the MicroMason
    Distribution

VERSION 2 HISTORY
  Version 1.993
    2007-12-20
        Merge changes from pair Networks local branch, which have been in
        testing and production since Q1 2007; bump version to 1.993.

        This includes:

        TemplatePath mixin
          Template lookups on a search path

        TemplateDir/ Cache patch
           fix interaction of caching and TemplateDir/TemplatePath

        Additional test files
        Stop creating cache objects unless/until they're used

  Version 1.992_01
    2007-12-20
        Updated pod and makefiles for maintenance transition from Simon to
        Alan. Thanks for the wonderful module, Simon! I hope I can keep
        things under control.

        Bumped version number.

  Version 1.992
    2005-11-13
        Updated ToDo.pod with a few ideas for upcoming releases.

        Extended t/58-quicktemplate.t to demonstrate use of the pre_fill
        method.

    2005-11-12
        Fixed incorrect handling of default values for array or hash
        variables in an <%args> block. Thanks to Alexander for the bug
        report.

        Added extra newlines to the do blocks generated by Base's
        assemble(), so that <% exprs %> can contain a comment. Problem
        reported by Alexander.

        Improved error reporting by changing the file name embedded in the
        CPP-style line number comment at the top of each stretch of
        generated Perl code. Based on a problem report from Alexander. This
        does not fix the line numbering problem, but at least the file name
        is more helpful than it used to be.

    2005-08-24
        Added RoughDraft of "ParseInfo.pm" based on a reply to a question
        via email from Alexander.

    2005-07-30

        syntax classes. Changed it to be a mixin like the other classes,
        instead of a subclass.

        Switched to use of Class::MixinFactory and removed old class() and
        NEXT() methods.

        Extracted new interpret() method from inside of compile().

        reading text or a file.

        Added initial support for filtering interpolated expressions based
        on a patch and extended discussion with Alan Ferrency.

        Packaged as version 1.51 but not released to CPAN.

    2004-09-16
        Refactored to object-oriented implementation to allow subclassing.
        Inspired by discussion with Alan Ferrency about how to extend
        functionality.

        Started CodeCache subclass based on experimental caching code
        included in 1.07.

        Started TemplateDir subclass with base directory and relative path
        calculations based on a patch from Tommi Maekitalo.

        Incorporated patch from Tommi Maekitalo to put default values from
        an <%args> block into the %ARGS variable as well as the separate
        named variables.

        Created ServerPages subclass based on feature request from William
        Kern.

        Moved package documentation into separate ReadMe.pod.

VERSION 1 HISTORY
  Version 1.07
    2003-09-26
        Discard line break after <%perl> block as suggested by Tommi
        Maekitalo. Note that removing these line breaks may affect the
        rendering of your current templates! Although I am typically
        hesitant to change established behavior, this does improve the
        template output and brings us into line with HTML::Mason's behavior.

        Added $Debug flag and support for <%args> blocks based on a
        contribution by Tommi Maekitalo.

        Adjusted internals to allow block reordering, and added support for
        <%init> and <%once>.

        Released as Text-MicroMason-1.07.tar.gz.

  Version 1.06
    2003-09-04
        Changed the way that subroutines were scoped into the
        Text::MicroMason::Commands namespace so that Safe compartments with
        separate namespaces and shared symbols have the visibility that one
        would expect.

        Fixed a bug in which an unadorned percent sign halted parsing, as
        reported by William Kern at PixelGate. Added a test to the end of
        6-regression.t that fails under 1.05 but passes under 1.06 to
        confirm this.

        Simplified parser regular expressions by using non-greedy matching.

        Added documentation for *_file() functions. Corrected documentation
        to reflect the fact that template code is not compiled with "use
        safe" in effect by default, but that this might change in the
        future.

        Released as Text-MicroMason-1.06.tar.gz.

  Version 1.05
    2003-08-11
        Adjusted regular expression based on parsing problems reported by
        Philip King and Daniel J. Wright, related to newlines and EOF. Added
        regression tests that fail under 1.04 but pass under 1.05 to ensure
        these features keep working as expected.

        Added non-printing-character escaping to parser failure and
        debugging messages to better track future reports of
        whitespace-related bugs.

        Moved tests from test.pl into t/ subdirectory.

        Added experimental suppport for file code cache in
        compile_file_codecache.

        Released as Text-MicroMason-1.05.tar.gz.

  Version 1.04
    2002-06-23
        Adjusted regular expression based on parsing problems reported by
        Mark Hampton.

        Added file-include support with <& ... &> syntax.

        Documentation tweaks. Adjusted version number to simpler 0.00
        format. Released as Text-MicroMason-1.04.tar.gz.

    2002-01-14
        Documentation tweaks based on feedback from Pascal Barbedor. Updated
        author's contact information.

  Version 1.0.3
    2001-07-01
        Renamed from HTML::MicroMason to Text::MicroMason. Documentation
        tweaks. Released as Text-MicroMason-1.0.3.tar.gz.

  Version 1.0.2
    2001-04-10
        Munged interface for clarity. Added Safe support. Adjusted docs to
        reflect feedback from mason-users. Released as
        HTML-MicroMason-1.0.2.tar.gz.

  Version 1.0.1
    2001-03-28

        Released as HTML-MicroMason-1.0.1.tar.gz.

        Extended documentation; added makefile, test script. Renamed
        accumulator to $OUT to match Text::Template. Released as
