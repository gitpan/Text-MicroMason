    Changed the way that subroutines were scoped into the
    Text::MicroMason::Commands namespace so that Safe compartments with
    separate namespaces and shared symbols have the visibility that one
    would expect.

    Fixed a bug in which an unadorned percent sign halted parsing, as
    reported by William Kern at PixelGate. Added a test to the end of
    6-regression.t that fails under 1.05 but passes under 1.06 to
    confirm this.

    Simplified parser regular expressions by using non-greedy matching.

    Released as Text-MicroMason-1.06.tar.gz.

    Adjusted regular expression based on parsing problems reported by
    Philip King and Daniel J. Wright, related to newlines and EOF. Added
    regression tests that fail under 1.04 but pass under 1.05 to ensure
    these features keep working as expected.

    Added non-printing-character escaping to parser failure and
    debugging messages to better track future reports of
    whitespace-related bugs.

    Moved tests from test.pl into t/ subdirectory. Added experimental
    suppport for file code cache in compile_file_codecache. Released as
    Text-MicroMason-1.05.tar.gz.
