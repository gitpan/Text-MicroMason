    Discard line break after <%perl> block as suggested by Tommi
    Maekitalo. 

      UPGRADE COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
      Note that removing these line breaks may affect the rendering
      of your current templates! Although I am typically hesitant
      to change established behavior, this does improve the template
      output and brings us into line with HTML::Mason's behavior.

    Added $Debug flag and support for <%args> blocks based on a
    contribution by Tommi Maekitalo.

    Adjusted internals to allow block reordering, and added support for
    <%init> and <%once>.

    Released as Text-MicroMason-1.07.tar.gz.

    Changed the way that subroutines were scoped into the
    Text::MicroMason::Commands namespace so that Safe compartments with
    separate namespaces and shared symbols have the visibility that one
    would expect.

    Fixed a bug in which an unadorned percent sign halted parsing, as
    reported by William Kern at PixelGate. Added a test to the end of
    6-regression.t that fails under 1.05 but passes under 1.06 to
    confirm this.

    Simplified parser regular expressions by using non-greedy matching.

    Added documentation for *_file() functions. Corrected documentation
    to reflect the fact that template code is not compiled with "use
    safe" in effect by default, but that this might change in the
    future.

    Released as Text-MicroMason-1.06.tar.gz.

    Adjusted regular expression based on parsing problems reported by
    Philip King and Daniel J. Wright, related to newlines and EOF. Added
    regression tests that fail under 1.04 but pass under 1.05 to ensure
    these features keep working as expected.

    Added non-printing-character escaping to parser failure and
    debugging messages to better track future reports of
    whitespace-related bugs.

    Moved tests from test.pl into t/ subdirectory.

    Added experimental suppport for file code cache in
    compile_file_codecache.

    Released as Text-MicroMason-1.05.tar.gz.
