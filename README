NAME
    Text::MicroMason::Docs::ReadMe - About the MicroMason Distribution

MOTIVATION
    The HTML::Mason module provides a useful syntax for dynamic template
    interpretation (sometimes called embedded scripting): plain text (or
    HTML) containing occasional chunks of Perl code whose results are
    interpolated into the text when the template is "executed."

    However, HTML::Mason also provides a full-featured web application
    framework with numerous other functions, and there are times in which
    I'd like to use the templating capability without configuring a full
    Mason installation.

    Thus, the Text::MicroMason module was born: it supports the core aspects
    of the HTML::Mason syntax ("<%...%>" expressions, "%...\n" lines and
    "<%perl>...</%perl>" blocks, "<& file &>" includes, "%ARGS" and
    "$_out->()"), and omits the features that are web specific (like
    autohandlers) or are less widely used (like "<%method>" blocks).

    You may well be thinking "yet another dynamic templating module?
    Sheesh!" And you'd have a good point. There certainly are a variety of
    templating toolkits on CPAN already. (For a brief list see
    Text::MicroMason::Docs::Related.)

    Nonetheless, I think this module occupies a useful niche: it provides a
    reasonable subset of HTML::Mason syntax in a very light-weight fashion.
    In comparison to the other modules listed, MicroMason aims to be fairly
    lightweight, using one eval per parse, converting the template to an
    cacheable unblessed subroutine ref, eschewing method calls, and
    containing less than a thousand lines of Perl code. It is also highly
    modular, allowing users to select and enable the combination of features
    they desire.

DISTRIBUTION STATUS
    This is version 1.99 of Text::MicroMason.

    This is an BETA version on a development track for a 2.0 release.

    This module has been available on CPAN for over two years.

    If you encounter any problems, please inform the author and I'll
    endeavor to patch them promptly.

    This module's CPAN registration should read:

INSTALLATION
    This module should work with any version of Perl 5, without platform
    dependencies.

    There is one pre-requisite module not included with the core
    distribution which must be installed from CPAN: Class::MixinFactory.

    You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
    interface:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Text::MicroMason'

    Alternately, you may retrieve this package from CPAN
    ("http://search.cpan.org/~evo/") or from the author's site
    ("http://www.evoscript.org/Text-MicroMason").

    After downloading the distribution, follow the normal procedure to
    unpack and install it, using the commands shown below or their local
    equivalents on your system:

      tar xzf Text-MicroMason-*.tar.gz
      cd Text-MicroMason-*
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test && sudo make install

SUPPORT
    If you have questions or feedback about this module, please feel free to
    contact the author at the below address. Although there is no formal
    support program, I do attempt to answer email promptly.

    I would be particularly interested in any suggestions towards improving
    the documentation, correcting any Perl-version or platform dependencies,
    as well as general feedback and suggested additions.

    Bug reports that contain a failing test case are greatly appreciated,
    and suggested patches will be promptly considered for inclusion in
    future releases.

    You can report bugs via the CPAN web tracking system, or send mail to
